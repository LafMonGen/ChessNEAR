# ChessNEAR
Chess on NEAR blockchain

This is example of turn based game with 2 persons with RUST backend and 2 variants of website (frontend) for it (first variant strored in src/lib.rs in web4 as base64 string or you can just copy it from https://1chess.testnet.page).
Many thanks to https://github.com/niklasf/shakmaty as I use it on the backend for move checking and win conditions.
