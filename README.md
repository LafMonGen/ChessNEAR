# ChessNEAR
Chess on NEAR blockchain

This is example of turn based game with 2 persons with RUST backend and 2 variants of website (frontend) for it (first variant stored in src/lib.rs web4 interaction as base64 string or you can just copy it from https://1chess.testnet.page). Second variant stored in index.html or just copy it from https://1chess.near.page

Many thanks to https://github.com/niklasf/shakmaty as I use it on the backend for move checking and win conditions.

Build of smartcontract is the same as in this tutorial https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/contracts/rust/intro
